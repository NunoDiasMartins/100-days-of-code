# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise Three number sum from AlgoExpert

**Thoughts:**
This challenge took me 1hour and I need to use the hints. I got blocked trying to optimize from th beginning. I should always try the basic approach first and then understand how I could simplify and optimize. That is what the Hints end up helping me.

### Day 2: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise Smallest Difference from AlgoExpert

**Thoughts:**
This challenge took me 1hour to implement but I didn't use any hint. it took me more on the implementation dumb errors during code. The implementation was not the best performance but I was following the correct path and idea. 

### Day 3: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Move element to end' and the 'Monotonic array' from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
I was able to provide two solution for the first problem. the first solution was a worst performance O(n log(n)), the second one was the desired O(n)
Did both solution in less than 25 minutes.
The 'Monotonic array' was be able to complete in 20 minutes.
Today  I was able to do it without any hint or blocking issue. I was a good day!

### Day 4: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Spiral Traverse array'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
It took me +1hour to solve the problem. I didn't use any HINT but i was able to find a solution somehow quickly but the implementation took me more because of the turn of the rows. It was some mistakes playing with the array mainly the factor calculation.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
