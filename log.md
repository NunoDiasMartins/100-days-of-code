# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise Three number sum from AlgoExpert

**Thoughts:**
This challenge took me 1hour and I need to use the hints. I got blocked trying to optimize from th beginning. I should always try the basic approach first and then understand how I could simplify and optimize. That is what the Hints end up helping me.

### Day 2: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise Smallest Difference from AlgoExpert

**Thoughts:**
This challenge took me 1hour to implement but I didn't use any hint. it took me more on the implementation dumb errors during code. The implementation was not the best performance but I was following the correct path and idea.

### Day 3: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Move element to end' and the 'Monotonic array' from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
I was able to provide two solution for the first problem. the first solution was a worst performance O(n log(n)), the second one was the desired O(n)
Did both solution in less than 25 minutes.
The 'Monotonic array' was be able to complete in 20 minutes.
Today  I was able to do it without any hint or blocking issue. I was a good day!

### Day 4: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Spiral Traverse array'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
It took me +1hour to solve the problem. I didn't use any HINT but i was able to find a solution somehow quickly but the implementation took me more because of the turn of the rows. It was some mistakes playing with the array mainly the factor calculation.

### Day 5: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Longest Peak'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
It took me +1hour to solve the problem and i didn't like the solution it was much of try and fail. I made it more complex than should .tomorrow will revisit. 

### Day 6: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises 'array of products' and 'first duplicate value'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
The first  exercise quickly I did by using a O(n^2) solution, I tried to improve during a while but without success. I even used the Hints but I wasn't getting the idea. The second exercise I was able to complete with a O(n) solution but it was O(n) in space too.. The worst solution would be O(n^2) time. The solution was O(1) space. I read the Hint's but once again I wasn't getting the point. The best solution was related to the hints the problem statement was giving , like (you can mutate the array and all number are bigger than one and lower than array length). In general today I show some fatigue and unmotivated. Tomorrow will be a better day!

### Day 7: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises 'overlapping intervals' and 'BST construction'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
The first exercise completed in a couple of minutes (around 15) but the second I got stuck in the remove method  (the hardest one). I was able to complete the method passing majority of the test cases but I was struggling with some edge cases. End up looking to their solution nd replicate the code reusing part of mine. It was a mediocre day! In the question for BSt they ask what is the difference between the solution in recursive and iteratively. The solution using recursive consumes more  memory space, O(log (n)). But the code makes much more sense and more cleaning in this type of  exercises in my opinion.

### Day 8: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Build a new small project 'Generate Invites'


**Thoughts:**
Today it was a bit different from the others days. Today I built a new small project that will be useful for my weeding. I learn a bit of python to generate and manipulate (adding a code into the image) images.

### Day 9: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete one exercise 'Validate BST' from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
The exercise was easy but I demonstrated lack of knowledge in the BST search and behavior. Once again I make it complex and end up spending all the time trying to debug. Only after reading their solution I understood where the issue was happening. Unfortunately the Number.Min was not helping and i found out the existence of a Infinity global variable from typescript, but this was not excuse. I should not jump right away to the code.   Not a good day :(

### Day 10: January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete one exercise 'Min Height BST' from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
I was able to complete the exercise in more than 1hour. I got the idea pretty quick but the playing around with the index to insert in the BST was what pushed back. The day before I jump the challenge because I got a injure and spent a couple of hours in the hospital. Now I have a scar from living in Canada :')


### Day 11: January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises from AlgoExpert. The 'BST traverse' and 'Find the Kth largest value in a BST'


**Thoughts:**
I was able to complete the first exercise pretty easily after listen a bit of the goal of what were teh in-order, pre-order and post-order traverses. The second exercise consumed a bit more of my time, but once again I make it much more complex than it was. I was trying to implement with O(1) in space and that wouldn't be possible. Once I read the tips carefully and the time & space expectation it was less than 10 minutes to build the solution. The first exercise helped to rapidly build the second solution once I stop to make it complex.

### Day 12: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises from AlgoExpert. The 'invert binary tree' and 'reconstruction of a BST from a pre/Order array'


**Thoughts:**
I was able to complete both exercises less than an hour. the reconstruction exercise I could do a solution with a better performance instead of O(n^2).
With the remaining time i started a new exercise but I wasn't able to complete today, it was to calculate the diameter of a binary tree, I believe once again I was making to much complex.Tomorrow maybe I will try again.

### Day 13: January 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises from AlgoExpert. The 'binary tree diameter' and 'find successor'


**Thoughts:**
I was able to complete both exercises in a hour. The find successor I was able to picture the easy solution but more expense. Decided to read the hints and easily I was able to implement the best solution.

**Thoughts:**
I was able to complete both exercises less than an hour. the reconstruction exercise I could do a solution with a better performance instead of O(n^2).
With the remaining time i started a new exercise but I wasn't able to complete today, it was to calculate the diameter of a binary tree, I believe once again I was making to much complex.Tomorrow maybe I will try again.

### Day 14: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete just one exercises from AlgoExpert. The 'height tree balance'


**Thoughts:**

### Day 15: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete just one exercises from AlgoExpert. The 'Max subset sum no adjacent numbers

### Day 16: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Develop a small index page with a small script to count the months

**Thoughts:**
This was a small page and script to calculate the months from the 20/02/2009. It took a while because I didn't have much experience in creating dom directly from javascript and using the Date from JS.

### Day 17: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete just one exercises from AlgoExpert. The 'Number of ways to make a change' and start creating the app for the wedding page.

### Day 18: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Work on the wedding app, add a Invite model and kick off the invite api

### Day 19: January 23, 2022


**Today's Progress**:
Completed one exercises from AlgoExpert and work on the wedding app.
**Thoughts:**
