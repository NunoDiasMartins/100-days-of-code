# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise Three number sum from AlgoExpert

**Thoughts:**
This challenge took me 1hour and I need to use the hints. I got blocked trying to optimize from th beginning. I should always try the basic approach first and then understand how I could simplify and optimize. That is what the Hints end up helping me.

### Day 2: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise Smallest Difference from AlgoExpert

**Thoughts:**
This challenge took me 1hour to implement but I didn't use any hint. it took me more on the implementation dumb errors during code. The implementation was not the best performance but I was following the correct path and idea. 

### Day 3: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Move element to end' and the 'Monotonic array' from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
I was able to provide two solution for the first problem. the first solution was a worst performance O(n log(n)), the second one was the desired O(n)
Did both solution in less than 25 minutes.
The 'Monotonic array' was be able to complete in 20 minutes.
Today  I was able to do it without any hint or blocking issue. I was a good day!

### Day 4: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Spiral Traverse array'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
It took me +1hour to solve the problem. I didn't use any HINT but i was able to find a solution somehow quickly but the implementation took me more because of the turn of the rows. It was some mistakes playing with the array mainly the factor calculation.

### Day 5: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete the exercise 'Longest Peak'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
It took me +1hour to solve the problem and i didn't like the solution it was much of try and fail. I made it more complex than should .tomorrow will revisit. 

### Day 6: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises 'array of products' and 'first duplicate value'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
The first  exercise quickly I did by using a O(n^2) solution, I tried to improve during a while but without success. I even used the Hints but I wasn't getting the idea. The second exercise I was able to complete with a O(n) solution but it was O(n) in space too.. The worst solution would be O(n^2) time. The solution was O(1) space. I read the Hint's but once again I wasn't getting the point. The best solution was related to the hints the problem statement was giving , like (you can mutate the array and all number are bigger than one and lower than array length). In general today I show some fatigue and unmotivated. Tomorrow will be a better day!

### Day 7: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Complete two exercises 'overlapping intervals' and 'BST construction'  from AlgoExpert


**Thoughts:**
The first exercise completed in a couple of minutes (around 15) but the second I got stuck in the remove method  (the hardest one). I was able to complete the method passing majority of the test cases but I was struggling with some edge cases. End up looking to their solution nd replicate the code reusing part of mine. It was a mediocre day! In the question for BSt they ask what is the difference between the solution in recursive and iteratively. The solution using recursive consumes more  memory space, O(log (n)). But the code makes much more sense and more cleaning in this type of  exercises in my opinion.

### Day 8: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Build a new small project 'Generate Invites' 


**Thoughts:**
Today it was a bit different from the others days. Today I built a new small project that will be useful for my weeding. I learn a bit of python to generate and manipulate (adding a code into the image) images.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
